Description:
    Sets up Conversation in your Rails project. After running this generator
    you will get a new migration file create_conversations and an initializer
    config/initializers/conversation.rb with the default options

Examples:
    `rails g conversation`

You can also provide the chatterbox argument to configure Conversation to use Chatterbox:
This will also create an initializer under config/initializers/chatterbox.rb
You will then need to go ahead and uncomment the Chatterbox setup in the Conversation config file
    `rails g conversation chatterbox`
